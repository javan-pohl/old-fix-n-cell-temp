            Our iPhone X screen replacement service utilizes an OLED display which is comporable to the original and is much better in quality than the cheaper LCD alternative.

            These are all issues fixed by a screen replacement.
            We service the Westminster, Broomfield, Boulder, Arvada, and Denver areas.

          </p>
          <h3>iPhone X Screen Replacement Process</h3>
          <p>The method we use at FixNcell iPhone Repair to repair broken or cracked iPhone screens is to replace the entire screen assembly.  So, when we fix your cracked iPhone X screen, we replace the entire AMOLED screen assembly with a new one.  If your AMOLED iPhone X screen is still functioning normally without any flaws, we may be able to offer a bit of a discount on your iPhone X screen repair.  Call us for infos on getting your broken iPhone X screen fixed. Additionally, if the your iPhone X is blank, it could just be that it is in need of a new screen.
          </p>
          <h4>Touchscreen on iPhone X not working</h4>
          <p>If your iPhone X is not registering touch on your screen, most likely you need to have your iPhone X screen replaced.  Most touch issues are fixed by getting a new screen installed, as the Touch IC chips for the iPhone X are now located on the screens themselves.  That means if your iPhone X is having touchscreen issues, getting a new screen will fix the issue.
          </p>
          <h4>How is the iPhone X AMOLED Screen Different from LCD?</h4>
          <p>Starting with the iPhone X, Apple utilized an AMOLED screen, which is a departure from the LCD display technology they've used in prior iPhones.  With an LCD screen, a backlight illuminates an LCD panel which creates the colors and the pixels of the image you see on the screen.  With an AMOLED display, the individual pixels are both the source of light and color. One of the main advantages of an AMOLED screen on the iPhone X is that when a part of the screen goes black, the pixel goes completely blank and doesn't use any energy.  With an LCD display, the cell not only expends energy to create the black color, but the blacklight is still illuminating the cell (along with all other areas of the screen.)  So AMOLED screens have great energy saving potential. AMOLED screens also typically have better image quality overall, in terms of color and contrast.
            <br><br>
            If you find a cell phone repair shop offering an iPhone X Screen Repair at a significantly lower price than FixNcell, likely they are using the cheaper LCD alternative screen instead of the original quality AMOLED screen.
          </p>

        <h3>Why is iPhone X screen repair more expensive than other iPhone screen repairs?</h3>
        <p>Traditionally, iPhone screens have utilized liquid crystal displays, or LCD.  LCD screens have been easy to manufacture for decades. Starting with the iPhone X, however, Apple has started to utilize the more expensive, better-looking, thinner, and more energy efficient AMOLED screens in their iPhones. Unfortunately AMOLED screens are pretty new to the industry and therefore still expensive to produce.
        </p>
        <h3>What are the different types of iPhone X screens?</h3>
        <p>Currently, both of our iPhone X screens that we are using for install are premium grade, meaning that they have strong glass and adhesive, and both are made using OLED technology instead of LCD.  However, the more expensive version is made using a Soft OLED, which should be more durable than the iPhone X screen made using the Hard OLED display.  The original-grade iPhone X screens are made with Soft OLED displays.
        </p>
        <h2>Other iPhone X Repairs We Offer</h2>
        <p>In addition to replacing the screen, we can also fix other issues you may be having on your iPhone X.</p>
        <h3>iPhone X Not Charging</h3>
        <p>Over time, it's typical for the charging port on the iPhone X to wear out. Typically, your lightning charging cable will have a hard time fitting into the charging port on your iPhone X.  That means it's time to get your iPhone usb charging port fixed.
        </p>
